# Apriori_20Newsgroups
A python project that finds association rules in the 20 Newsgroups collection using the Apriori algorithm.

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, 
partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. 
To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: 
Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. 
The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, 
such as text classification and text clustering.

The project contains the dataset and a csv file with the association rules that was produced.
